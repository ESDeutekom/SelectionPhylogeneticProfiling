2	GO:0006915	apoptotic process	A programmed cell death process which begins when a cell receives an internal (e.g. DNA damage) or external signal (e.g. an extracellular death ligand), and proceeds through a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway phase) which trigger an execution phase. The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died.	0.007972404628376535	1.40313162334011	766	biological_process	9	['KRT20: keratin 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20412]', 'NAIP: NLR family

13	GO:0007249	I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling	The process in which a signal is passed on to downstream components within the cell through the I-kappaB-kinase (IKK)-dependent activation of NF-kappaB. The cascade begins with activation of a trimeric IKK complex (consisting of catalytic kinase subunits IKKalpha and/or IKKbeta, and the regulatory scaffold protein NEMO) and ends with the regulation of transcription of target genes by NF-kappaB. In a resting state, NF-kappaB dimers are bound to I-kappaB proteins, sequestering NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of I-kappaB targets I-kappaB for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus releasing the NF-kappaB dimers, which can translocate to the nucleus to bind DNA and regulate transcription.	0.00838201998881142	2.5936675461741423	80	biological_process	9	['NFKBIL1: NFKB inhibitor like 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7800]', 'TNF: tumor necrosis factor [Source:HGNC

Gemini of coiled bodies, or 'gems', are similar in size and shape to CBs, and often indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.008229409579178332	2.6031746031746033	15	cellular_component	9	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

29	GO:0030154	cell differentiation	The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state.	0.0020695111577668656	1.666376582278481	1092	biological_process	1	['MYT1: myelin transcription factor 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7622]', 'SBNO2: strawberry notch homolog 2 [Source:HGNC

It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	8.075073387007042e-05	2.548223350253807	66	cellular_component	1	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]',

55	GO:0005747	mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I	A protein complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane that forms part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	2.0847338289509614e-05	2.6417112299465244	66	cellular_component	4	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]',

59	GO:0097504	Gemini of coiled bodies	Nuclear bodies frequently found near or associated with Cajal bodies (also called coiled bodies or CBs). Gemini of coiled bodies, or 'gems', are similar in size and shape to CBs, and often indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.00764392938636525	2.641711229946524	15	cellular_component	4	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

67	GO:0007165	signal transduction	The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell.	0.0014932500940850197	1.5400441589723002	2408	biological_process	2	"['OPRL1: opioid related

Gemini of coiled bodies, or 'gems', are similar in size and shape to CBs, and often indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.007528696146448023	2.6497326203208553	15	cellular_component	2	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

92	GO:0030154	cell differentiation	The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state.	0.009964887936290077	1.6158095238095238	1092	biological_process	3	['MYT1: myelin transcription factor 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7622]', 'SBNO2: strawberry notch homolog 2 [Source:HGNC

97	GO:0008150	biological_process	A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence.	0.005513706797782716	2.328666666666667	635	biological_process	3	"['KRTAP1-5: keratin associated protein 1-5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:16777]', 'KRTAP1-3: keratin

100	GO:0005813	centrosome	A structure comprised of a core structure (in most organisms, a pair of centrioles) and peripheral material from which a microtubule-based structure, such as a spindle apparatus, is organized. Centrosomes occur close to the nucleus during interphase in many eukaryotic cells, though in animal cells it changes continually during the cell-division cycle.	0.003336356782578153	1.4676470588235295	548	cellular_component	3	"['CCDC92: coiled-coil domain containing 92 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:29563]', 'SPATC1L: spermatogenesis and centriole

It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	5.062355524783018e-05	2.6684491978609626	66	cellular_component	3	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]',

Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.007267825718002294	2.6684491978609626	15	cellular_component	3	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

115	GO:0070534	protein K63-linked ubiquitination	A protein ubiquitination process in which a polymer of ubiquitin, formed by linkages between lysine residues at position 63 of the ubiquitin monomers, is added to a protein. K63-linked ubiquitination does not target the substrate protein for degradation, but is involved in several pathways, notably as a signal to promote error-free DNA postreplication repair.	0.009350426957356165	2.0707124010554088	55	biological_process	5	['TRIM27: tripartite motif containing 27 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:9975]', 'TRIM27: tripartite motif containing 27 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:9975]', 'TRIM27: tripartite motif containing 27 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:9975]', 'TRIM27: tripartite motif containing 27 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:9975]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'BFAR: bifunctional apoptosis regulator [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17613]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'ITCH: itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13890]', 'RNF152: ring finger protein 152 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26811]', 'CDKN2A: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:1787]', 'MAGEL2: MAGE family member L2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:6814]', 'UBE2V1: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 V1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12494]', 'RNF4: ring finger protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10067]', 'STUB1: STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11427]', 'HECTD1: HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20157]', 'RNF126: ring finger protein 126 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:21151]', 'UBE2V2: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 V2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12495]', 'TRIM27: tripartite motif containing 27 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:9975]', 'NEDD4: NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7727]', 'TRAF1: TNF receptor associated factor 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12031]', 'UBE2D4: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 D4 (putative) [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:21647]', 'BFAR: bifunctional apoptosis regulator [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17613]', 'RNF5: ring finger protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10068]', 'TRAF2: TNF receptor associated factor 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12032]', 'RNF8: ring finger protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10071]', 'TRIM5: tripartite motif containing 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:16276]', 'TRAF3: TNF receptor associated factor 3 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12033]', 'UBE2E2: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 E2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12478]', 'TRIM56: tripartite motif containing 56 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:19028]', 'UBE2B: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 B [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12473]', 'RNF186: ring finger protein 186 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:25978]', 'TRAF3IP2: TRAF3 interacting protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:1343]', 'WWP2: WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:16804]', 'TRAF6: TNF receptor associated factor 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12036]', 'ARIH2: ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:690]', 'PELI1: pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:8827]', 'ZFP91: ZFP91 zinc finger protein, atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:14983]', 'UBE2N: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12492]', 'PRPF19: pre-mRNA processing factor 19 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17896]', 'PRKN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:8607]', 'PELI3: pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:30010]', 'UBE2S: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 S [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17895]', 'RNF115: ring finger protein 115 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:18154]', 'UBE2E3: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 E3 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12479]', 'RNF168: ring finger protein 168 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26661]', 'UBE2T: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 T [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:25009]', 'TRAF5: TNF receptor associated factor 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12035]', 'UBE2G1: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 G1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12482]', 'TRAF4: TNF receptor associated factor 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:12034]', 'RNF135: ring finger protein 135 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:21158]', 'UBE2O: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 O [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:29554]']

120	GO:0005747	mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I	A protein complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane that forms part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	6.564294352076618e-05	2.6005291005291	66	cellular_component	5	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]', 'MT-ND2:

124	GO:0097504	Gemini of coiled bodies	Nuclear bodies frequently found near or associated with Cajal bodies (also called coiled bodies or CBs). Gemini of coiled bodies, or 'gems', are similar in size and shape to CBs, and often indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.008271439250168652	2.6005291005291	15	cellular_component	5	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

133	GO:0006915	apoptotic process	A programmed cell death process which begins when a cell receives an internal (e.g. DNA damage) or external signal (e.g. an extracellular death ligand), and proceeds through a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway phase) which trigger an execution phase. The execution phase is the last step of an apoptotic process, and is typically characterized by rounding-up of the cell, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular volume (pyknosis), chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), plasma membrane blebbing and fragmentation of the cell into apoptotic bodies. When the execution phase is completed, the cell has died.	0.009826896262040804	1.3982363315696649	766	biological_process	10	['KRT20: keratin 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20412]', 'NAIP: NLR family

It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	2.228567555154626e-05	2.625994694960212	66	cellular_component	6	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]',

162	GO:0097504	Gemini of coiled bodies	Nuclear bodies frequently found near or associated with Cajal bodies (also called coiled bodies or CBs). Gemini of coiled bodies, or 'gems', are similar in size and shape to CBs, and often indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs); they contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons (SMN) whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis, and to play a role in the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).	0.007876955617886249	2.625994694960212	15	cellular_component	6	['SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'GEMIN8: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 8 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:26044]', 'GEMIN2: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 2 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:10884]', 'HABP4: hyaluronan binding protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:17062]', 'SMN2: survival of motor neuron 2, centromeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11118]', 'SMN1: survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:11117]', 'GEMIN6: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20044]', 'GEMIN5: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20043]', 'GEMIN7: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 7 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:20045]', 'DDX20: DEAD-box helicase 20 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:2743]', 'NPAT: nuclear protein, coactivator of histone transcription [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7896]', 'ZPR1: ZPR1 zinc finger [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:13051]', 'GEMIN4: gem nuclear organelle associated protein 4 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:15717]']

185	GO:0030154	cell differentiation	The process in which relatively unspecialized cells, e.g. embryonic or regenerative cells, acquire specialized structural and/or functional features that characterize the cells, tissues, or organs of the mature organism or some other relatively stable phase of the organism's life history. Differentiation includes the processes involved in commitment of a cell to a specific fate and its subsequent development to the mature state.	0.006434271080186315	1.6375641966250918	1092	biological_process	8	['MYT1: myelin transcription factor 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7622]', 'SBNO2: strawberry notch homolog 2 [Source:HGNC

193	GO:0005747	mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I	A protein complex located in the mitochondrial inner membrane that forms part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It contains about 25 different polypeptide subunits, including NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), flavin mononucleotide and several different iron-sulfur clusters containing non-heme iron. The iron undergoes oxidation-reduction between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and catalyzes proton translocation linked to the oxidation of NADH by ubiquinone.	2.053904822683236e-05	2.6453333333333333	66	cellular_component	8	['MT-ND1: mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1 [Source:HGNC Symbol;Acc:HGNC:7455]',
